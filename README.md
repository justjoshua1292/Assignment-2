#MY PORTFOLIO (Update #3)
Portfolio: 
This website was updated to highlight my skills and work in coding so far. As we know, it's very limited but this is just the start. This page will be updated frequently throught the next six months, so don't be afraid. I've used placeholder images for now. Work will be updated throughout each chapter. This page has used most of the elements we've learned so far, except for javascript. On this page, you'll find some placeholder images, a banner image, a small tidbit about me, placeholder images for my work and resume sections and in the Contact me section, you'll find some links that I will update as the program goes by as well. By the end of this program, You'll know me very intimately. Still working on the mobile interface aspect of it. I'll update it one more time.

The sections can be found in order: "About Me, Work, Resume, & contact me! " You'll also find a small picture of me on the page as well that i used to fit the color scheme of the page that I created. Top of the HTML: You can find the meta data, as well as the metadata containing the info for the webpage. The new title - "Joshua" - which is also my name, semantic HTML tags throughout, ID's & classes used to identify blocks on the page. I mixed in some purple borders as well followed by a footer.

Bonus= The ("") next to everything on the page is a nod to fashion designer Virgil Abloh, who incorporates this into his art.

This isn't my best work, but i'm proud because a few weeks ago, I wouldn't have been able to build this. I've worked on it for quite a few days now. Can't wait for the feedback that's coming!
